# Element Highlighting

Element Highlighting is a powerful feature that allows you to draw attention to specific elements on your page during demos. This is particularly useful for:
- Guiding users through complex interfaces
- Highlighting important features
- Creating interactive tutorials
- Drawing attention to specific UI elements

> [!NOTE]
>
> We are working on a chrome extension that will allow you to highlight elements on any website without having to add an `id` prop. Coming soon!

## Basic Usage

Add an `id` attribute to any element you want to highlight in your demo:

```tsx filename="components/Dashboard.tsx" {1} copy
<Card id="revenue-chart">
  <h1>Revenue Overview</h1>
  <BarChart data={revenueData} />
</Card>
```

## Best Practices

1. **Meaningful IDs**: Use descriptive IDs that reflect the purpose of the element
2. **Accessibility**: Ensure highlighted elements remain accessible
3. **Performance**: Avoid highlighting too many elements simultaneously
4. **Responsive Design**: Test highlighting behavior across different screen sizes

> [!TIP]
>
> Use element highlighting in combination with tooltips for more effective guided tours.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Element highlighting works with any HTML element or React component that accepts an `id` prop.
